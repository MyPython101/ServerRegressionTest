## Tools:

2) Hand drawing

## I) Design Alternative:
- [Design Alternative 1](https://www.figma.com/file/CuQb0Mk5oNUXyj5N5ervhD/?node-id=0%3A1) (Choosen one)
- [Design Alternative 2](https://www.figma.com/file/CuQb0Mk5oNUXyj5N5ervhD/?node-id=1%3A2)
- [Design Alternative 3](https://www.figma.com/file/CuQb0Mk5oNUXyj5N5ervhD/?node-id=70%3A834) (Hand drawing)

## II) Reason to choose:

We chose the digital design alternative because the design has a good user interface and is interactive along with that the user can easily understand 
what is present in the website and can easily navigate through the tabs. The sub-sections under each tab is clearly and easily divided so that the user 
does not have any problem with searching for what he/she wants.
